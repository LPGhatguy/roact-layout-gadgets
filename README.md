# Roact Layout Gadgets (RLG)
**Super early WIP, there's nothing usable here yet.**

This is a place to drop some R&D for an idea I've seen floated around: style-agnostic Roact utilities for laying out complicated UI.

Some of the ideas that this repository will aim to cover may be solved by upcoming Roblox UI features, like automatic sizing from contents. Hopefully, this repository will help provide guidance for what kinds of layout controls will be useful!

Some notable ideas I'd like to cover:

- Bottom-up vs top-down sizing and when to pick each
- Flexible layout constraints, potentially via pure functions and bindings
- Animation capability!
